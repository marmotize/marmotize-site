Finally, after years of procrastination, I start this blog!

I am a 29 year old Software Engineer turned AI Engineer based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

I will be writing under this online alias for now "Marmotize" for my love of marmots and alpine animals in general. But perhaps I will use my real name in the future.

I will be sharing my thoughts and notes on my journey as a developer in this fast-paced AI era.

Topics I am planning to cover:

- Search and Information Retrieval
- AI Engineering (evals, tracing, agents, LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, and prompting)
- Improving productivity with AI
- Chrome extension development

My inspirations are:

- [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev/)
- [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/)
- [Shreya Shankar](https://www.sh-reya.com/)
- [Leonie Monigatti](https://leoniemonigatti.com/)
- [Rachel Thomas in Why you (yes,you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)
- [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)

Stay tuned for more updates!

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to Marmotize!
